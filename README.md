This repository is a curated list of research papers, projects, and resources related to the application of **Agentic AI / AI agents for healthcare**, including medical image analysis, EHR manipulation, counseling, drug discovery, patient dialogue, and healthcare administration. AI agents refer to artificial intelligence systems that can autonomously perform tasks, make decisions, and interact with their environment, often through the use of large language models (LLMs), multi-agent systems, and tool integrations.

1. The image below introduces a comprehensive conceptual framework. It provides a holistic view, detailing the pipeline from initial data perception and foundational agent capabilities to a hierarchical application ecosystem.

2. We conducted a quantitative analysis of recent academic literature, with the key findings summarised in the image below. This analysis provides a data-driven snapshot of the field’s growth trajectory, technological underpinnings, and application hotspots:

* **Top Data Modalities**: Textual data remains the most frequently utilized modality. Time-Series and Genomics exhibit a high proportion of publications from 2025.
* **Top Technologies**: The technological focus is heavily concentrated on three topics: 1) developing highlevel Frameworks, 2) enhancing agent Reasoning, and 3) designing Multi-Agent collaboration paradigms.
* **Top Application Domains**: Agentic AI continues to be widely applied in broad domains like General Medicine, Public Health, and Mental Health. Drug Discovery and Genomics are particularly new frontiers.
